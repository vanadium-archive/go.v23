// Package arith is an example of an IDL definition in veyron.  The syntax for
// IDL files is similar to, but not identical to, Go.  Here are the main
// concepts:
//   * PACKAGES - Just like in Go you must define the package at the beginning
//     of an IDL file, and everything defined in the file is part of this
//     package.  By convention all files in the same dir should be in the same
//     package.
//   * IMPORTS - Just like in Go you can import other idl packages, and you may
//     assign a local package name, or if unspecified the basename of the import
//     path is used as the import package name.
//   * DATA TYPES - Just like in Go you can define data types.  You get most of
//     the primitives (int32, float64, string, etc), the "error" built-in, and a
//     special "any" built-in described below.  In addition you can create
//     composite types like arrays, structs, etc.
//   * CONSTS - Just like in Go you can define constants, and numerics are
//     "infinite precision" within expressions.  Unlike Go numerics must be
//     typed to be used as const definitions or tags.
//   * INTERFACES - Just like in Go you can define interface types, which are
//     just a set of methods.  Interfaces can embed other interfaces.  Unlike
//     Go, you cannot use an interface as a data type; interfaces are purely
//     method sets.
//   * ERRORS - Errors may be defined in IDL files, and unlike Go they work
//     across separate address spaces.
package arith

// Test the import mechanism.
import (
	"veyron.io/veyron/veyron2/vdl/testdata/base"
)

// Constants.
const (
	// Yes shows that bools may be untyped.
	Yes      = true // yes trailing doc
	// No shows explicit boolean typing.
	No       = bool(false)
	Hello    = "hello"
	// Int32Const shows explicit integer typing.
	Int32Const    = int32(123)
	// Int64Const shows explicit integer conversion from another type, and referencing
	// a constant from another package.
	Int64Const    = int64(Int32Const + base.Five)
	// FloatConst shows arithmetic expressions may be used.
	FloatConst    = float64(3.0 / 2 + 0.5)
	// Mask shows bitwise operations.
	Mask     = uint64(0x1 << 8)
)

// Arith is an example of an interface definition for an arithmetic service.
// Things to note:
//   * There must be at least 1 out-arg, and the last out-arg must be error.
type Arith interface {
	// Add is a typical method with multiple input and output arguments.
	Add(a int32, b int32) (int32, error)

	// DivMod shows that runs of args with the same type can use the short form,
	// just like Go.
	DivMod(a, b int32) (quot, rem int32, err error)

	// Sub shows that you can use data types defined in other packages.
	Sub(args base.Args) (int32, error)

	// Mul tries another data type defined in another package.
	Mul(nested base.NestedArgs) (int32, error)

	// GenError shows that it's fine to have no in args, and no out args other
	// than "error".  In addition GenError shows the usage of tags.  Tags are a
	// sequence of constants.  There's no requirement on uniqueness of types or
	// values, and regular const expressions may also be used.
	GenError() error {"foo", "bar" + "z", Hello, int32(Int64Const + 1), base.SixSquared}

	// Count shows using only an int32 out-stream type, with no in-stream type.
	Count(Start int32) stream<_, int32> error

	// StreamingAdd shows a bidirectional stream.
	StreamingAdd() stream<int32, int32> (total int32, err error)

	// QuoteAny shows the any built-in type, representing a value of any type.
	QuoteAny(a any) (any, error)

	// A calculator can do basic arithmetic.

	Off() error {"offtag"}  // Off turns the calculator off.
